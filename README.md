# Modeling-of-Harvested-Energy-from-Soil-Cell
Harvested energy from the soil is modeled based on experiments conducted.

In this study, several experiments were conducted under the lab environment to obtain the I-V and the P-V characteristics of the soil cell. Based on these results an equivalent circuit model of the source is presented here..
